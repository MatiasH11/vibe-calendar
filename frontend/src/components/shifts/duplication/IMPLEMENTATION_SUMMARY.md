## Supporting Components Created

### UI Components
- ✅ `DatePicker` - Multi-select date picker component
- ✅ `MultiSelect` - Multi-select dropdown with search
- ✅ `Checkbox` - Custom checkbox component
- ✅ `Switch` - Toggle switch component
- ✅ `Separator` - Visual separator component
- ✅ `Collapsible` - Collapsible content sections

### Utility Functions
- ✅ `formatTime` - Time formatting utility (HH:mm to 12-hour format)
- ✅ `formatDate` - Date formatting utility (YYYY-MM-DD to readable format)
- ✅ `debounce` - Debounce function with cancel capability

## Integration Points

### API Integration ✅
- Connected to existing `shiftsApiService` methods:
  - `duplicateShifts()` - For shift duplication
  - `createBulkShifts()` - For bulk shift creation
  - `previewBulkShifts()` - For operation preview
  - `validateConflicts()` - For conflict validation

### Template Integration ✅
- Integrated with `ShiftTemplateSelector` component
- Uses `useShiftTemplates` hook for template data
- Automatic time filling from selected templates

### Type Safety ✅
- Full TypeScript integration with existing type system
- Proper handling of `EmployeeWithShifts` structure
- Type-safe API request/response handling
- Conflict resolution enum integration

## Build Status ✅
- ✅ All components compile successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ Build passes with only minor ESLint warnings (non-blocking)

## Testing & Documentation ✅
- ✅ Component test files created
- ✅ Comprehensive README with usage examples
- ✅ Implementation summary documentation
- ✅ Integration examples provided

## Next Steps
The duplication and bulk operations functionality is now complete and ready for integration into the main shift management interface. The components can be used in modals, sidebars, or dedicated pages as needed.

All requirements from the specification have been satisfied, and the implementation follows the established patterns and conventions of the existing codebase.
